#### Welcome to the world of Machine Learning!

Machine learning is a field of research where, rather than explicitly programming computers, computers learn to make sense of the world by utilizing data. You have probably come across learning algorithms without knowing it. If you have ever used a camera with face detection or have been recommended a book by Amazon, you have interacted with learning algorithms! In recent years, we have come to more fully understand these algorithms, and, coupled with increases in computational power and the proliferation of data, there has been exciting progress within the field. Still, there is a long way to go and a lot we can learn about! We hope that you will join us as we set out to learn more about these algorithms and their consequences on our lives!

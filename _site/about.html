## About

The ML Group is a University of Tennessee student driven organization focused on machine learning. We believe in the value of interdisciplinary collaboration between people of diverse backgrounds.
Whether you have never written a line of code or have been on the cutting edge of neural network research since before the great AI winter, you have a place with us!

##### A note from Todd as we enter 2017:

<p>
We support all people regardless of race, gender, religion, and political affiliation. As an organization focussed on learning, we support diversity and
are supported by diversity. No matter who you are, you are welcome at the ML Group.
